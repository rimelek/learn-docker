============================================================
Create your own PHP application with built-in PHP web server
============================================================

Go to Project 3 from the git repository root:

.. code:: bash

  cd projects/p03

Build an image:

.. code:: bash

  docker build -t localhost/p03_php .

Start the container:

.. code:: bash

  docker run -d --name p03_php -p "8080:80" localhost/p03_php

Open in a web browser and reload the page multiple times.
You can see the output is different each time with more lines.

Now delete the container. Probably you already now how, but as a reminder I show you again:

.. code:: bash

  docker rm -f p03_php

Execute the "docker run ..." command again and reload the example web page to
see how you have lost the previously generated lines and delete the container again.

Now start the container with a volume to preserve data:

.. code:: bash

  docker run -d --mount source=p03_php_www,target=/var/www --name p03_php -p "8080:80" localhost/p03_php


This way you can delete and create the container repeatedly a you will never lose your data until you delete the volume.
You can see all volumes with the following command:

.. code:: bash

  docker volume ls
  # or
  docker volume list

After you have deleted the container, you can delete the volume:

.. code:: bash

  docker volume rm p03_php_www
