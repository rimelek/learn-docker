.. _nginx-proxy: https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxproxy/nginx-proxy

==================================================================
Run more Docker Compose project on the same port using nginx-proxy
==================================================================

See `nginx-proxy`_

Go to Project 6 from the git repository root:

.. code:: bash

  cd projects/p06

Create the proxy network:

.. code:: bash

  docker network create public_proxy

Check the networks:

.. code:: bash

  docker network ls

Navigate to the nginxproxy folder

.. code:: bash

  cd nginxproxy

Start the proxy:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose up -d

Navigate to the web1 folder:

.. code:: bash

  cd ../web1

At this point you need to have the NIP variable set as :doc:`../../index` refers to it.

Alternative option: set the NIP variable in the ".env" file:

Start the containers:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose up -d

In case are working in the cloned repository of this tutorial, you can also run the below command to set the variable

.. code:: bash

  NIP=$(../../../system/usr/local/bin/nip.sh) docker compose up -d

Navigate to the web2 folder:

.. code:: bash

  cd ../web2

Start the containers:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose up -d

In case are working in the cloned repository of this tutorial, you can also run the below command to set the variable

.. code:: bash

  NIP=$(../../../system/usr/local/bin/nip.sh) docker compose up -d

Both of the services are available on port 80. Example:

.. code:: text

  http://web1.192.168.1.6.nip.io
  http://web2.192.168.1.6.nip.io

This way you do not need to remove a container just because it is running on the same port you want to use for a new container.

Clean the project:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose down --volumes
  cd ../web1
  docker-compose down --volumes
  cd ../nginxproxy
  docker-compose down --volumes
