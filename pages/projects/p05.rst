Communication of PHP and Apache HTTPD web server with the help of Docker Compose
================================================================================

Go to Project 5 from the git repository root:

.. code:: bash

  cd projects/p05

Build PHP image and start the containers:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose up -d

Start multiple container for PHP:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose up -d --scale php=2

List the containers to see PHP has multiple instance:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose ps

Open the page in your browser and you can see the hostname in the first line is not constant. It changes but not every time, although the data is permanent.

Delete everything created by Docker Compose for this project:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose down --volume
