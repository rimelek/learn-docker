.. _Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

======================================
Create a simple Docker Compose project
======================================

Go to Project 4 from the git repository root:

.. code:: bash

  cd projects/p04

Build an image and start the container using `Docker Compose`_:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose up -d


Check the container:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose ps
  # The name of the container: p04_php_1

Check the networks:

.. code:: bash

  docker network ls
  # New bridge network: p04_default

Delete the container, and networks with Docker Compose:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose down

Or delete the volumes too.

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose down --volume

docker-compose down
