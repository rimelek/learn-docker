.. _Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

======================================
Create a simple Docker Compose project
======================================

Go to Project 4 from the git repository root:

.. code:: bash

  cd projects/p04

Project structure:

.. code:: text

  .
  ├── Dockerfile
  ├── docker-compose.yml
  └── www
      └── index.php

The content of index.php

.. literalinclude:: ../../projects/p04/www/index.php
  :language: php

the compose file

.. literalinclude:: ../../projects/p04/docker-compose.yml
  :language: yaml

and the Dockerfile

.. literalinclude:: ../../projects/p04/Dockerfile
  :language: Dockerfile

Build an image and start the container using `Docker Compose`_:

.. code:: bash

  docker compose up -d


Check the container:

.. code:: bash

  docker compose ps
  # The name of the container: p04_php_1

Check the networks:

.. code:: bash

  docker network ls
  # New bridge network: p04_default

Delete the container, and networks with Docker Compose:

.. code:: bash

  docker compose down

Or delete the volumes too.

.. code:: bash

  docker compose down --volumes
