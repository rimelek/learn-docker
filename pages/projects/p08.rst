=========================================
Memory limit test with PHP in a container
=========================================

Go to Project 8 from the git repository root:

.. code:: bash

  cd projects/p08

Description
===========

This example shows the memory testing in a PHP container, where the "truncate"
command generates a file with a defined size and the PHP reads it into the memory.
We use an environment variable to set the memory size.

Start the test
==============

The container will have 50MB memory limit. (It must be at least 6MB in Docker Compose 1.27.4). 
The examples below will test the memory usage from 10MB to 50MB increased by 10MB for each test.

.. code:: bash

  MEMSIZE=10MiB docker compose run --rm php
  MEMSIZE=20MiB docker compose run --rm php
  MEMSIZE=30MiB docker compose run --rm php
  MEMSIZE=40MiB docker compose run --rm php
  MEMSIZE=50MiB docker compose run --rm php

output:

.. code:: text

  bash: line 5:     9 Killed                  php -r '
     ob_start();
     readfile("/tmp/50MiB");
     ob_clean();
     echo (memory_get_peak_usage(true)/1024/1024)." MiB\n";
  '


"Killed" means we exceeded the memory limit. There is no error until 50MB.
Since there is some additional memory usage in the container, it kills the process at 50MiB even though 50 is still allowed.

Explanation of the parameters
=============================

The "docker-compose run" is similar to "docker run", but it runs a service from the compose file.
"--rm" means the same as it meant for "docker run". Deletes the container right after it stopped.

Clean the project:

.. code:: bash

  docker compose down

The containers were deleted automatically, but it can still delete the network.
