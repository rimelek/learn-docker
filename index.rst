My name is Ákos Takács and I really like working with Docker containers and containers in general.
I decided to share my experience so I created this page to help you through your journey in learning Docker
and related tools and concepts.
I am a moderator on `forums.docker.com`_, I'm on YouTube (`@itsziget`_ (Hungarian), `@akos.takacs`_ (English)),
and you can follow me on `Twitter`_

In this project I share explanations, examples and scripts.
The examples were originally made for the participants of the Ipszilon Seminar in 2017 in Hungary. 
The virtual machines were created in the Cloud For Education system. Since then I added more contents
and I will continue to do so.

Before you start working with the example projects, read :doc:`pages/intro/getting-started`.
